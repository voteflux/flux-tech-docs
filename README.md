# Flux Technical Roadmap

This respository is for:

* Discussion of Flux tech docs and plans
* A place for people to openly criticise and contribute to the Flux roadmap and its implementation
* A place to discuss the direction, intention, and implementation of the roadmap

ATM [Max](https://voteflux.org/about/who/) is maintaining this repo.

## Contribution and Guidelines

To contribute the easiest way is through the GitHub interface. You can create and edit documents, comment on issues, etc. You should submit a **pull request** to have something added or changed. _(When you do this a copy of this repository will be made on your account with your changes. A **pull request** is a request to 'pull' your changes into the main repository.)_

* All questions/discussion should be initiated [by creating a new issue](https://github.com/voteflux/flux-tech-roadmap/issues/new)
* The purpose of this repository is as stated above - please keep this in mind when participating
* Use tags where possible to identify questions into some of the common categories
* Meta conversation is allowed (e.g. discussion of these guidelines)
* Quote the important bit of what you're replying to unless they're within a few posts above you
* Mention people when you reply to them (using @username, e.g. @XertroV)
* Use Markdown for writing documents/comments - [guide - seems good](https://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown), [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), 

### Contribution Guidelines

* [Constitutions and the like](https://github.com/voteflux/flux)

## Near Term Roadmap

- [ ] - Figure out community discussion forums - [#1](../../issues/1)
  * [some discussion on problems with discourse and possible solutions](https://gist.github.com/XertroV/d503a1e9db4bc1fd617c5ee20a619c4c)
  * tl;dr - [self hosted discourse](https://community.voteflux.org) is not working out so well, one idea is to use a thin layer over github issues (free, enduring, easy-ish)

- [ ] - Add [Contributing.md](Contributing.md) - [#4](../../issues/4)
  * Sources of ideas: [Fallible Ideas](http://fallibleideas.com/discussion/guidelines) - not 100% applicable but good foundation, [ThoughtBot code of conduct](https://thoughtbot.com/open-source-code-of-conduct) - note: would prefer to just allow discussion of conduct w/o going to authority-based extremes; simple and non-authoritarian is good

- [ ] - Build community into repository control
  - [ ] - Build a small team of 5 core maintainers. Progress: 1/5
- [ ] - Add and maintain [TechJournal.md](TechJournal.md)
- [ ] - Lay out ideas for the website + membership backend
- [ ] - Lay out ideas for longer term blockchain solution + oracles
- [ ] - Document current tech stack + setup - [#2](../../issues/2)
- [ ] - Open source membership backend - [#3](../../issues/3)
- [ ] - Rebuild membership interface (ideally using Elm)
- [ ] - Add documentation facility using Sphinx [#9](../../issues/9)
